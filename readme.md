## Learning Objectives
1. Use Testing to TDD JavaScript code 
1. Understand basic JavaScript - functions, control structures, scope.

## Summary
Revisit the [Roman Numerals](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/33) challenge in JavaScript. Since you already know how to solve this, focus on using TDD and finding a more eloquent solution while implementing it in JavaScript. 
* Open the `roman.html` file in chrome and the console to see your first failing test.  
* Write all your tests in the `roman_spec file` and all your solution code in the `roman.js` code.
* If you like you can make a visual assert function to show your failing tests in the html (see below).

## Releases 
### Release 1
* Convert numbers 1 to 100 to roman.

### Release 2
* Convert numbers 1 to 1000 to roman.

### Release 3
*  Add HTML so a user can type in a number and see it's roman conversion. (NO SERVER)
